About:
At a very young age, Kristin and Marisa – sisters and best friends – have known that they would go into business together. The sisters grew up in Miami, FL then embarked on separate adventures, but came back to live once again together in New Orleans, LA, Paris, France and San Francisco, CA. They tend to say the same thing at the same time and have affectionately been known to be ‘partners in wine.’ Although their similarities stand out, so do their differences – making for perfect business partners. Together they bring the perfect combination of creativity, sass, business, and customer service.

Kristin is a nationally published writer and editor who has spent the last 10+ years writing about everything from fashion, design and decor to culture, gourmet food and wine. Celebrated for her timeless style, passion for perfection and unmatched service level to her clients, Kristin loves to fuss over all the little details – from color palettes, to invitation fonts to flowers – and can help make your wedding day or event everything you’ve dreamed of and more.

Marisa has nearly a decade of experience planning small-and-large-scale events for various non-profit organizations, managing a portfolio of national accounts in diverse industries, as well as conducting community outreach and business development. It’s said that Marisa can be a perfectionist, coordinating every aspect of an event to ensure flawless execution. Under pressure, she remains enthusiastic, full of energy and has excellent time management and organizational skills.

These days, the sister’s passions include spending time with family, spoiling their pets, planning and hosting events that create a buzz, traveling to both familiar and new places, cooking, wine tasting, shopping for the perfect shirt or pair of flats, and home décor.
